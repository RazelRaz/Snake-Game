# Snake Game

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer. This project is a web-based implementation of the Snake Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

In the Snake Game, the player controls a snake represented by a series of connected squares on a grid. The objective is to navigate the snake to eat food that randomly appears on the grid. As the snake eats the food, it grows longer, making it more challenging to avoid collisions with its own body or the walls.

The game features intuitive controls using the arrow keys to change the snake's direction of movement. Pressing the spacebar allows the player to pause the game. The score is displayed, indicating the number of food items eaten.

The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body. Upon game over, the player can restart the game by pressing OK.

## Features

- Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys.
